# Mobile File Upload Implementation

## Overview

This BuildFire plugin implements a platform-optimized file upload strategy with different size limits for mobile and desktop platforms to provide the best user experience on each device type.

## Platform-Specific Limits

### Mobile (iOS & Android)

**File Size Limits:**
- **Maximum:** 1GB (1024 MB) per file
- **Enforced by:** BuildFire server (no client-side validation)
- **Rationale:** Mobile devices have native file pickers that handle large files efficiently

**Implementation:**
- Uses `buildfire.services.publicFiles.showDialog` for modern BuildFire apps
- Falls back to `buildfire.imageLib.showDialog` for legacy mobile apps
- Native OS file selection experience (Photos app on iOS, Gallery on Android)
- Supports multiple file selection
- Real-time upload progress indicators
- Server-side validation prevents files over 1GB

**Supported Formats:**
- **Images:** JPEG, JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- **Videos:** MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM, QuickTime, M4V, MKV

### Desktop/Web

**File Size Limits:**
- **Images:** 10 MB per file (client-side validation)
- **Videos:** 100 MB per file (client-side validation)
- **Enforced by:** Client-side validation before upload

**Implementation:**
- Uses `buildfire.imageLib.showDialog` with `showFiles: true` option
- **Unified Experience:** BOTH camera (📷) and video (🎥) buttons allow selection of images AND videos
- Automatically separates images and videos after selection
- Pre-upload validation prevents unnecessary network traffic
- Clear success messages showing what was selected (e.g., "2 image(s) and 1 video(s) selected")
- Optimized for web browser environment
- Similar experience to modern social media apps

## Why Different Limits?

### Mobile Advantages (1GB limit)
1. **Native File Handling:** Mobile OS provides optimized file picker and upload handling
2. **Direct Camera Access:** Users can capture high-quality photos/videos directly
3. **Modern Hardware:** Mobile devices typically have fast cellular/WiFi connections
4. **User Expectations:** Mobile users expect to share full-resolution media from their camera roll

### Desktop Experience (10MB/100MB limits)
1. **Browser Limitations:** Web browsers have less efficient file handling than native apps
2. **Network Reliability:** Desktop uploads may occur over less reliable connections
3. **User Experience:** Faster upload validation provides immediate feedback
4. **Bandwidth Optimization:** Prevents unnecessary large file uploads that may fail
5. **Unified Interface:** Both camera and video buttons support images AND videos for flexibility

## Technical Implementation

### File Selection Flow

```
User clicks camera 📷 or video 🎥 button
    ↓
Check if BuildFire mobile API available
    ↓
[YES - Mobile]                              [NO - Desktop]
    ↓                                           ↓
publicFiles.showDialog                  imageLib.showDialog
    ↓                                      (showFiles: true)
Native file picker                              ↓
    ↓                                  Select images AND/OR videos
No size validation                              ↓
    ↓                            Auto-separate images and videos
Upload to BuildFire                             ↓
    ↓                              Validate < 10MB/100MB per file
Server enforces 1GB limit                       ↓
                                        Upload if valid
                                                ↓
                            Display combined success message
                         (e.g., "2 images and 1 video selected")
```

### Code References

**Constants:** `widget/enums.js`
```javascript
FILE_UPLOAD: {
    MOBILE_MAX_SIZE: 1024,       // 1GB for mobile
    DESKTOP_IMAGE_MAX_SIZE: 10,  // 10MB for desktop images
    DESKTOP_VIDEO_MAX_SIZE: 100  // 100MB for desktop videos
}
```

**Image Upload:** `widget/controllers/widget.wall.controller.js` - `WidgetWall.selectImages()`

**Video Upload:** `widget/controllers/widget.wall.controller.js` - `WidgetWall.selectVideos()`

## Error Handling

### Mobile Error Scenarios
- **File > 1GB:** BuildFire server returns error after upload attempt
- **Unsupported format:** Client filters by MIME type before upload
- **Upload failure:** Toast notification with retry option
- **Network issues:** BuildFire SDK handles automatic retry

### Desktop Error Scenarios
- **File too large:** Immediate error message before upload
- **Unsupported format:** File type validation before upload
- **Upload failure:** Clear error message with retry option

## Testing Checklist

### Mobile Testing
- [ ] Test image upload on iOS device (Photos app picker)
- [ ] Test image upload on Android device (Gallery picker)
- [ ] Test video upload on iOS device
- [ ] Test video upload on Android device
- [ ] Verify multi-file selection works
- [ ] Test upload of file close to 1GB limit
- [ ] Verify error handling for files over 1GB
- [ ] Check upload progress indicators display correctly
- [ ] Test on older BuildFire SDK versions (fallback API)

### Desktop Testing
- [ ] Test image upload on Chrome browser
- [ ] Test image upload on Safari browser
- [ ] Test image upload on Firefox browser
- [ ] Test video upload on all browsers
- [ ] Verify 10MB limit enforced for images
- [ ] Verify 100MB limit enforced for videos
- [ ] Test error messages display correctly
- [ ] Verify multi-file selection works

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Progressive Upload:** Chunk large files for better reliability
2. **Compression Options:** Offer to compress images/videos before upload
3. **Format Conversion:** Auto-convert incompatible formats
4. **Cloud Storage:** Direct upload to user's cloud storage
5. **Offline Queue:** Queue uploads when offline, process when online

### Monitoring Recommendations
1. Track upload success rates by platform
2. Monitor average file sizes uploaded
3. Analyze upload failure reasons
4. Measure user engagement with media uploads
5. Track server-side file rejection rates
